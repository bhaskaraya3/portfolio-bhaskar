📊 Superstore Sales & Operations Intelligence Dashboard (SQL → Power BI)

🔍 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence analysis built on the Superstore dataset, focusing on revenue growth, customer value, product performance, geographic concentration, and delivery efficiency.

The workflow follows an industry-grade BI pipeline:
SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conversion of business logic into optimized DAX measures
Interactive Power BI dashboards designed for executive decision-making

The goal was not just visualization, but extracting actionable insights and identifying improvement opportunities for business growth.

🧠 Business Questions Answered
The dashboards were structured around real business questions, not metrics for the sake of metrics:
How is the business performing overall?
Which products and categories actually generate revenue?
Who buys, where do they buy from, and how valuable are they?
Is delivery speed aligned with revenue, or creating operational risk?

🛠️ Tech Stack
SQL (MySQL / SQLite) – Data exploration, aggregation, validation
Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards
DAX – KPI logic, performance metrics, operational benchmarks
Python – Data preparation & loading
GitHub – Project versioning & documentation

📊 Dashboard Pages & Insights

1️⃣ Executive Overview
Purpose: Overall business health snapshot
Key Insights:
Revenue growth peaked in 2017 and stabilized, indicating market maturity
Order volume continues to rise despite revenue stabilization
Consumer segment and West region dominate total revenue

2️⃣ Product & Category Performance
Purpose: Identify revenue-driving products and portfolio concentration
Key Insights:
Technology category contributes the highest revenue, indicating stronger pricing power
Chairs and Phones lead at the sub-category level
A small set of products contributes disproportionately to total sales

3️⃣ Customer & Geographic Analysis
Purpose: Understand customer value and regional dependence
Key Insights:
Consumer segment drives the highest revenue volume
Home Office customers generate the highest Average Order Value
Revenue is geographically concentrated in the West region
Clear trade-off between customer volume and customer value

4️⃣ Operations & Delivery Performance
Purpose: Evaluate whether operational efficiency supports revenue
Key Insights:
Standard Class shipping generates the majority of revenue but has the longest delivery times
A significant portion of revenue is associated with delayed deliveries
Delivery speed is not fully aligned with revenue contribution, indicating operational risk

🚨 Business Gaps & Improvement Opportunities
Revenue dependence on a single shipping mode increases customer experience risk
High-value orders experiencing delays require priority operational optimization
Opportunity to rebalance shipping strategies for high-revenue segments
Potential pricing or service differentiation for faster delivery options

🏁 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates how SQL, DAX, and Power BI can be combined to move beyond dashboards and deliver decision-ready business insights, highlighting both growth drivers and operational weaknesses.

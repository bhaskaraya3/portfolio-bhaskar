        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                I work with data to turn messy numbers into <strong>clear, actionable insights</strong>. I specialize in
                building interactive dashboards in <strong>Power BI and analyzing data using SQL, Python, and
                    Excel</strong> to support better decision-making.<br><br>
                I regularly work on <strong>data analysis projects, dashboards, and machine learning concepts</strong>,
                and I share my work publicly to learn faster, improve continuously, and build credibility.<br><br>
                I am open to <strong>internships, entry-level roles, and collaborations</strong> in data analytics and
                related fields.
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">My Journey Into Data</h1>
            <p>
                My journey into data began with programming in school, where <strong>Python</strong> was my first
                language. Over time, my interest shifted from writing code to understanding how businesses operate
                through data across domains like <strong>fintech, edtech, and sales</strong>.<br><br>
                As I grew and explored different career paths within programming, I became particularly interested in
                data and how organizations rely on it to function. Looking at datasets helped me understand how
                decisions are made and outcomes are driven by <strong>numbers rather than assumptions</strong>.<br><br>
                This exposure shifted my mindset. I didn't just want to write code, I wanted to understand what the data
                was saying and turn <strong>raw numbers into meaningful visuals and insights</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">How I Approach Data</h1>
            <p>
                I start by <strong>understanding the structure of the dataset</strong>, reviewing columns and possible
                relationships. I then clean with intent—handling missing values, duplicates, and
                inconsistencies.<br><br>
                Once clean, I use <strong>SQL to explore trends, correlations, and business context</strong>, and
                <strong>Python to visualize insights</strong> clearly and effectively.
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Skills & Current Focus</h1>
            <p>
                I am confident with <strong>advanced SQL, Power BI, and Python libraries</strong> such as Pandas, NumPy,
                and Matplotlib. I focus on building dashboards and analyses that translate data into decisions.<br><br>
                At the same time, I am strengthening my understanding of <strong>statistics, DAX, and machine learning
                    fundamentals</strong> to go beyond what happened and understand <strong>why it happened</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Goals & Direction</h1>
            <p>
                The rapid impact of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> on today's world and its long-term
                potential strongly motivates me. Beyond the obvious growth opportunities in this space, I am deeply
                curious about how intelligent systems learn from data and how those insights can scale decision-making
                across industries.<br><br>
                Over the next one to two years, my focus is on building a <strong>strong professional
                    foundation</strong> by working in data-driven roles where I can gain real-world experience, sharpen
                my analytical thinking, and work closely with business data.<br><br>
                I see <strong>data analysis as a critical stepping stone</strong> — one that builds the intuition,
                discipline, and context required to grow into an <strong>AI/ML engineering role</strong> over time.
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">What I'm Actually Looking For</h1>
            <p>
                I am open to a wide range of opportunities, including <strong>remote internships, full-time roles,
                    part-time work, freelance projects, and collaborations</strong> in data analytics and related
                fields.<br><br>
                I am especially interested in roles where I can <strong>work with real data, take ownership of tasks,
                    and continuously improve</strong> through hands-on experience.<br><br>
                I value <strong>learning-focused and structured environments</strong>, including corporate teams where
                clear processes, accountability, and collaboration are encouraged. Working alongside experienced
                professionals and contributing meaningfully to shared goals is something I actively look for.

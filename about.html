            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I work with data to turn messy numbers into clear, actionable insights.
                I specialize in building interactive dashboards in Power BI and analyzing
                data using SQL, Python, and Excel to support better decision-making.
            </p>

            <p>
                I regularly work on data analysis projects, dashboards, and machine
                learning concepts, and I share my work publicly to learn faster, improve
                continuously, and build credibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am open to internships, entry-level roles, and collaborations in data
                analytics and related fields.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">My Journey into Data</h5>

            <p>
                My journey into data began with programming in school, where Python was my
                first language. Over time, my interest shifted from writing code to
                understanding how businesses operate through data across domains like
                fintech, edtech, and sales.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I grew and explored different career paths within programming, I became
                particularly interested in data and how organizations rely on it to
                function. Looking at datasets helped me understand how decisions are made
                and outcomes are driven by numbers rather than assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This exposure shifted my mindset. I didn’t just want to write code; I wanted
                to understand what the data was saying and turn raw numbers into meaningful
                visuals and insights.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">How I Approach Data</h5>

            <p>
                I start by understanding the structure of the dataset, reviewing columns
                and possible relationships. I then clean with intent—handling missing
                values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once clean, I use SQL to explore trends, correlations, and business context,
                and Python to visualize insights clearly and effectively.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Skills & Current Focus</h5>

            <p>
                I am confident with advanced SQL, Power BI, and Python libraries such as
                Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I focus on building dashboards and analyses
                that translate data into decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, I am strengthening my understanding of statistics, DAX,
                and machine learning fundamentals to go beyond what happened and understand
                why it happened.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Goals & Direction</h5>

            <p>
                The rapid impact of artificial intelligence on today’s world and its long-term potential strongly
                motivates me. Beyond the obvious growth opportunities in this space, I am deeply curious about how
                intelligent systems learn from data and how those insights can scale decision-making across industries.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the next one to two years, my focus is on building a strong professional foundation by working in
                data-driven roles where I can gain real-world experience, sharpen my analytical thinking, and work
                closely with business data. I see data analysis as a critical stepping stone — one that builds the
                intuition, discipline, and context required to grow into an AI/ML engineering role over time.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">What I’m Looking For</h5>

            <p>
                I am open to a wide range of opportunities, including remote internships, full-time roles, part-time
                work, freelance projects, and collaborations in data analytics and related fields. I am especially
                interested in roles where I can work with real data, take ownership of tasks, and continuously improve
                through hands-on experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                I value learning-focused and structured environments, including corporate teams where clear processes,
                accountability, and collaboration are encouraged. Working alongside experienced professionals and
                contributing meaningfully to shared goals is something I actively look for.
            </p>
